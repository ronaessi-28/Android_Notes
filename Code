Perfect 👍 Viney, now I’ll redesign the coding questions properly like a real internal assessment paper.

I’ll give:

🎯 Clear Problem Statement

📌 Requirements

🔒 Constraints

⭐ Expected Output

🧠 What examiner checks


We’ll do this for Set A, Set B, and Set C.


---

🧠 SET A – Coding Practice (Detailed)


---

🔹 Q1 (Basic – Kotlin Lambdas & Higher Order Functions)

📝 Problem Statement:

Create a Kotlin program where:

You define a higher-order function named calculate.

It should take:

Two integers

One lambda function as a parameter


The lambda should perform a mathematical operation.

Call the function for:

Addition

Multiplication




---

📌 Requirements:

1. Create function:

fun calculate(a: Int, b: Int, operation: (Int, Int) -> Int): Int


2. Call it using:

Lambda for addition

Lambda for multiplication



3. Print the results.




---

⭐ Expected Output:

Addition Result: 15
Multiplication Result: 50


---

🧠 Examiner Checks:

Correct lambda syntax

Understanding of higher-order functions

Correct function return type



---


---

🔹 Q2 (Medium – Coroutines Network Simulation)

📝 Problem Statement:

Create an Android activity that:

1. Shows a button "Fetch Data"


2. When clicked:

Start coroutine

Switch to IO dispatcher

Simulate network call using delay(3000)

Return result to Main thread

Display result in TextView





---

📌 Requirements:

Use CoroutineScope

Use Dispatchers.IO

Use withContext(Dispatchers.Main)

Use delay()

Show loading message before delay



---

⭐ Expected Flow:

1. Click button


2. TextView → "Loading..."


3. Wait 3 seconds


4. TextView → "Data Fetched Successfully"




---

🔒 Constraints:

Do NOT use AsyncTask

Must use Coroutines



---

🧠 Examiner Checks:

Correct dispatcher usage

Thread switching knowledge

Coroutine builder understanding



---


---

🧠 SET B – Coding Practice (Detailed)


---

🔹 Q1 (Basic – Scope Functions)

📝 Problem Statement:

Create a User data class with:

name

age

city


Use apply scope function to:

Create object

Initialize values

Print details using also



---

📌 Requirements:

1. Define data class


2. Use:

val user = User().apply { ... }


3. Print using:

user.also { println(it) }




---

⭐ Expected Output:

User(name=Viney, age=22, city=Delhi)


---

🧠 Examiner Checks:

Correct use of this in apply

Understanding difference between apply & also



---


---

🔹 Q2 (Medium – Bound Service)

📝 Problem Statement:

Create:

One Activity

One Bound Service


Service should:

Generate random number

Return it to Activity


Activity should:

Bind to service

Call service method

Display number in TextView



---

📌 Requirements:

Override:

onBind()


Create inner Binder class

Use:

bindService()



---

⭐ Expected Flow:

1. Activity starts


2. Service binds


3. Button click → show random number




---

🔒 Constraints:

Must use Binder

No Intent extra allowed



---

🧠 Examiner Checks:

Proper binding lifecycle

IBinder understanding

Service connection handling



---


---

🧠 SET C – Coding Practice (Detailed)


---

🔹 Q1 (Basic – Extension Function)

📝 Problem Statement:

Create an extension function for String:

Function name: isPalindrome()

Return true if string is palindrome

Ignore case sensitivity



---

📌 Requirements:

1. Write:

fun String.isPalindrome(): Boolean


2. Test it with:

"madam"

"Hello"





---

⭐ Expected Output:

madam -> true
Hello -> false


---

🧠 Examiner Checks:

Correct extension syntax

String manipulation logic



---


---

🔹 Q2 (Medium – Custom Content Provider)

📝 Problem Statement:

Create a custom Content Provider that:

Supports:

Insert

Query


Data stored in:

SQLite database


Another activity should:

Insert student record

Fetch all records

Display in Logcat



---

📌 Requirements:

1. Extend ContentProvider


2. Override:

onCreate()

insert()

query()



3. Define URI


4. Register provider in Manifest




---

⭐ Expected Flow:

1. Insert student


2. Query returns all students


3. Logcat shows results




---

🔒 Constraints:

Must use ContentResolver

Must define authority in Manifest



---

🧠 Examiner Checks:

URI handling

CRUD understanding

IPC concept clarity



---

🎯 Very Important Practice Advice

Since you are preparing seriously, I recommend:

🔁 Practice in this order:

1. Coroutines


2. Bound Service


3. Content Provider


4. Extension functions


5. Scope functions
